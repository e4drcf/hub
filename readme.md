# LBRY Hub

A hub provides back-end services to LBRY clients. Services include

- URL resolution
- search
- wallet services (getting and sending transactions, address subscription)
- hub federation and discovery

This project will eventually subsume and replace the 
[wallet server](https://github.com/lbryio/lbry-sdk/blob/v0.92.0/docker/Dockerfile.wallet_server) 
and the [lighthouse](https://github.com/lbryio/lighthouse) search provider.
